# GoldenLayoutNgApp

This application demonstrates how to use GoldenLayout inside an Angular (version 10) application.

It uses the a preliminary (at the time of this writing) port of GoldenLayout to TypeScript which can be downloaded from:
  [https://github.com/pbklink/golden-layout](https://github.com/pbklink/golden-layout)

This uses a technique written up by Carlos Roso: [Angular Pro Tip: How to dynamically create components in \<body\>](https://medium.com/hackernoon/angular-pro-tip-how-to-dynamically-create-components-in-body-ba200cc289e6)

Thanks also to ttquang1063750 whose post on Stack Overflow pointed me in the right direction:
